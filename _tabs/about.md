### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

So, I guess I did it - I started a blog! ðŸŽ‰  This is where I'll be sharing all sorts of things that are bouncing around in my head: projects I'm tinkering with, interesting tidbits I've learned, and maybe some random thoughts.  Think of it as my digital brain dump - a way to keep track of everything before it disappears into the void.

My main passions lie in the fields of Machine Learning, Operations Research, Statistics and programming in general.  You'll probably see that most posts are related to those topics, but who knows, maybe I'll pivot somewhere else.

Feel free to poke around and see what catches your eye.  And if you have any feedback, questions or want to chat, just reach out!
