### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

So, I guess I did it - I started a blog! ðŸŽ‰  This is where I'll be sharing all sorts of things that are bouncing around in my head: projects I'm tinkering with, interesting tidbits I've learned, and maybe some random thoughts.  Think of it as my digital brain dump - a way to keep track of everything before it disappears into the void.

My main passions lie in the fields of Machine Learning, Operations Research, Statistics and programming in general.  You'll probably see that most posts are related to those topics, but who knows, maybe I'll pivot somewhere else.

Feel free to poke around and see what catches your eye.  And if you have any feedback, questions or want to chat, just reach out!

#### P.S.

This website is built using the [Chirpy template](https://chirpy.cotes.page/), a Jekyll theme based on the Ruby framework for generating static websites. While my knowledge of Ruby, Jekyll, and web development is very limited, the documentation is pretty straightforward. So I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a simple yet powerful way to create a website.
