## My Blog

This blog is a collection of some thoughts, projects and learning outcomes.

Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions!

## Acknowledgements

This website is built using the [Chirpy template][use-template], a Jekyll theme based on the [Ruby framework][gem] for generating static websites. While my knowledge of Ruby, Jekyll, and web development is very limited, the [documentation](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) is pretty straightforward. So I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a simple yet powerful way to create a personal website.
